This repo contains the code and content for my [blog](https://ossd-s24.github.io/shriyakalakata-weekly/ "Shriya Kalakata's Open Source Blog") for my open source software development class.

This blog chronicles my learning journey in open source software development throughout the course. I write about things I'm learning, projects I'm working on, and my perspectives on open source.
