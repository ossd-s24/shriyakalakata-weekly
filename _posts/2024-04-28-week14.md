title: Week 14 - Open Source Beyond Software
---

When you hear "open source", you likely think of things like Linux, Wikipedia, or Firefox - community-driven software projects where the code is openly shared and collaboratively developed. Atleast, those are some projects that come to my mind first. However, the open source philosophy of transparency, community involvement, and free sharing of information is being applied well beyond just software. A wide range of projects across various domains are embracing open source ideals to drive innovation and democratize access to knowledge and resources.

One fascinating example is [Open Source Sports](https://opensourcesports.io/) (OSS), a platform dedicated to crowdsourcing the best rules and formats for sports and competitive events. OSS involves a diverse team of developers, athletes, enthusiasts and more working together to refine the rulesets for both official sports like the UFC and NFL as well as novel, community-created games. The open nature allows for rapid iteration and incorporating a multitude of perspectives.

The open source mentality is also being applied to digital content like photography, video, 3D models and more. Sites like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) host vast libraries of openly-licensed images, videos and other assets that anyone can use, remix or build upon. This gives access to high-quality content for everyone from students to businesses.

The world of open hardware is an exciting frontier as well. Rather than sharing code, the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://www.oshwa.org/) involves sharing design files like schematics, 3D models and more to allow anyone to study, modify and manufacture physical objects and machines. This allows for grassroots innovation in areas like 3D printing, robotics, and beyond.

From modular agricultural machinery to prosthetics to open libraries of books, music and academic research â€“ open philosophies are sprouting up everywhere as people aim to democratize access to resources and collaborate on tackling major challenges. The principles of transparency, collaboration and free sharing of information that drove open source software are proving powerful when applied more broadly. It will be fascinating to see what other domains begin to embrace open source thinking in the years ahead.
