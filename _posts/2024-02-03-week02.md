title: Week 2 - The Role of Code of Conduct
---

Open source communities are diverse, distributed, and at times disorganized - often spanning dozens of countries and hundreds if not thousands of people. Like any other human communities, issues can arise without clear guidelines around expected behavior and acceptable interactions. That's where codes of conduct come into play for open source projects.

Codes of conduct set clear expectations for behavior and help ensure all contributors feel safe and welcome to participate. Without them, projects can become breeding grounds for discrimination, harassment, and other toxic dynamics that drive people away. By establishing shared guidelines upfront, codes of conduct empower communities to have productive dialogue to resolve conflicts and develop strong norms.

### Examining Codes of Conduct in Practice

In my exploration of open source codes of conduct, I've come across several based on templates like the  Contributor Covenant, such as the Go project, Eclipse, and Matplotlib, and some from the Ubuntu Code of Conduct, like Sugar Labs. Itâ€™s interesting to see how each one puts their own spin on it.

The Go project's take stands out to me for its incorporation of "Gopher values," which gives the guidelines a homegrown feel aligned with that community's norms. Rather than strictly enforcing rules, it approaches things from a conflict resolution standpoint - encouraging healthy debate while keeping communication constructive.

The Sugar Labs Code of Conduct also grabbed my attention with its addition of an entire section dealing with maintainers leaving. By considering the bus factor - risk of losses in transitions - they also emphasize sustaining community strength over the long haul. 

It's inspiring to see how centralized templates get customized to the cultures of diverse open source ecosystems. While codes of conduct should cover some consistent ground like anti-harrassment policies, they seem most effective when evolved organically from a group up rather than imposed top-down.

### Enforcement Challenges

While codes of conduct have been becoming more popular, living up to them raises tough questions. They can clearly address major incidents like harassment or discrimination. But what about subtle cases of excluding behavior? Microaggressions or unconscious bias that alienates marginalized groups?

The subjective nature makes consistent enforcement really tricky, though some projects are paving the way with thoughtful processes. Matplotlib's graded system stood out to me as a potential model, starting from correction, warnings, temporary bans, and ultimately permanent bans for those violating the Code of Conduct. Clear procedures empower moderators to uphold standards.

Of course perfectly enforcing any complex social guidelines proves impossible. But in my eyes, the very exercise of collaboratively crafting a code of conduct surfaces important conversations and plants seeds of more inclusive norms. If projects back that up with at least some infrastructure to address problems, it provides recourse for mitigating issues that arise.

I'm curious to hear from those with experience moderating communities here, especially in the open source world. What challenges have you faced upholding codes of conduct? And what lessons might you share for making them as impactful as possible? Enforcement may have inconsistencies, but the need for these conversations themselves remains rock solid.

### Weighing the Importance as a Contributor

I believe codes of conduct provide huge value for setting inclusive community tones. But their absence isn't necessarily a deal-breaker. At least for me, as a relatively new contributor. Every project and maintainer team has its own norms and cultures after all. I'm eager to dive in and get a feel for how communication and collaboration play out on the ground level. 

That said, published codes of conduct go a long way in signaling that diversity and respect matter. At the end of the day, the people make open source projects as much as the code does.
