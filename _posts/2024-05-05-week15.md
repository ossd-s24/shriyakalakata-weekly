title: Week 15 - The End of a Chapter, But Not The Journey
---

As my final semester at NYU draws to a close, I find myself reminiscing about the incredible experiences I've had throughout my academic journey. This blog post marks the end of a chapter, but it is certainly not the end of my personal journey or my contributions to the world of open source software.

Looking back on this class dedicated to open source, I can confidently say that it exceeded my expectations. While I wasn't entirely sure what to anticipate, I am leaving feeling thoroughly satisfied and happy with the knowledge and skills I've gained. It has been a fitting culmination to my run at NYU.

One of the highlights of this class was our group project focused on pandas, the popular open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python. Working alongside my teammates, I had the opportunity to tackle various documentation issues, fix errors raised due to function docstrings, and engage with the vibrant pandas community.

The experience of collaborating on an open-source project was truly rewarding. We navigated through the challenges of remote teamwork, effective communication, and managing contributions to a large-scale codebase. It was a hands-on lesson in the intricacies of open-source development, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked on such a widely-used and impactful project.

As I reflect on the presentations from this week and the progress our group has made, I can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and excitement for what lies ahead. I have developed a deep appreciation for the power of community-driven software development and the impact it can have on the world. Moving forward, I am committed to continuing my contributions to open-source projects, fostering a spirit of collaboration and knowledge-sharing.

This is not goodbye, but rather a new beginning, as I embark on the next chapter of my open-source journey.
Thank you, Prof. Klukowska, for providing me with this incredible opportunity to explore the world of open source. It has been a remarkable experience, and I can't wait to see where the open-source path will lead me next.
